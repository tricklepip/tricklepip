- 👋 Hi, I’m @tricklepip
- 👀 I’m interested in web technologies, tabletop games, and DeFi.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte. I am not yet familiar with React and the other popular frameworks, but I am likely to pick them up sometime this year.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, as my free time is going into my final project.
